In Spring 2024, I took Professor Lingqi Yan's offering of [CS 292F: Real-Time High Quality Rendering](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/cs292f.html) at UCSB. I came into this class with little to no previous experience in computer graphics. I wrote a "developer diary" to guide future students through the class, which can be found [here](https://rohildshah.github.io/2024/08/09/cs-292f-survival-guide.html).

Here is a visual summary of my results for each project.

## Project 2: Global Illumination Techniques (SSDO only)

Between RSM, VXGI, SSDO, and SSR, I chose to implement SSDO.
