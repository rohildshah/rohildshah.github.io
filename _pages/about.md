Hi, I'm Rohil. 👋

I am a 4th-year Computer Science undergraduate at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) within the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). I am currently a student researcher in the **UCSB Neural Information Retrieval Lab**, advised by [Prof. Tao Yang](https://cs.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/tao-yang).

**I am applying to MS/Ph.D. programs in Computer Science for the 2026 academic year.**

My research focuses on the intersection of **Systems and Machine Learning**. I am interested in designing the data infrastructure and retrieval logic required to support reliable, large-scale Agentic AI systems.

I am currently investigating **efficient hybrid retrieval architectures**: combining dense semantic embeddings with learned sparse representations to improve search quality without sacrificing efficiency. My daily work involves open-source vector search libraries like [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) and experimenting with dynamic pruning strategies on the [MS MARCO benchmark](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/). I am broadly interested in how we can co-design retrieval algorithms with low-level systems infrastructure to handle the latency constraints of modern agents.

Previously, I interned at [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com/), where I built agents and RAG pipelines for root cause analysis on system logs. Before that, I worked at [Inogen](https://www.inogen.com/) on medical device simulation, app development, and firmware testing. Beyond my technical work, I founded the [UCSB ACM Student Chapter](https://www.ucsbacm.com/). Watching this community take root and learning from the incredible students, faculty, and staff at UCSB has been a highlight of my time here.

If you are interested in discussing efficient retrieval, AI systems, or distributed infrastructure, feel free to reach out!
